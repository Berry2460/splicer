# OOF File Splicer

## How it works
- The Splicer program will splice a large file into smaller 8MB files
- The Stitcher program will piece the smaller 8MB files back together

### Side notes
- Please specify file name and extension for splicing. *eg: bob.txt*
- Place all the .OOF files in the same directory as the Stitcher and it will automatically work on running.
